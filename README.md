This repository is mainly meant to store and display the cumulative group project I worked on with 2 fellow students. 
Through the duration of the semester, we were given a case study and asked to follow the systems development life cycle, focusing on planning, analysis, and design.
We employed various Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams such as Use Case Diagrams, Class Diagrams, State Machine Diagrams, among others, to simulate the life cycle.
These diagrams were edited with instructor feedback then collated into a SDLC Diagram Portfolio.
