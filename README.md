This repository is mainly meant to store and display the cumulative group project I worked on with 2 fellow students. 
Through the duration of the semester, we were given a case study and asked to follow the systems development life cycle, focusing on planning, analysis, and design.
We employed various Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams such as Use Case Diagrams, Class Diagrams, State Machine Diagrams, among others, to simulate the life cycle.
These diagrams were edited with instructor feedback then collated into a SDLC Diagram Portfolio. 

The Class Materials Folder include the lab manuals given to us by the instructor, along with various supporting documents.
The Diagram Submissions folder holds all of the diagrams that we created that were eventually added into our SDLC Diagram Portfolio.
